Welcome to Quantarhei's Documentation!
======================================

This page should one day be the main complete source of documentation
for **Quantarhei** package. We describe Quantarhei's main features and 
the philosophy behind them. Large part of this documentation is based directly
on the source code. Inspecting the source code should be an important part
of learning to use Quantarhei. Not only that one can learn to use Quantarhei
better by inspecting the source code. In a better case you learn something
usefull from how open quantum systems' problems are solved in Quantarhei,
in a worse case, you will be motivated to fix Quantarhei's deficiencies. 

There two types of deficiencies you can expect in Quantarhei - a mild one:
things work well but programming style is terrible, or things are not
implemented in a general enough manner. In this case you are most welcome
to fix the code. Make sure that your improvement passes all automatic tests.
Here we provide a detailed description of the classes provided by Quantarhei.

A more serious defficiency is when you find that something is really
implemented wrongly. The best approach then is to write an alternative
test code which demonstrates the errors. Submit this to the maintainers
and when they agree that the error is real, go ahead to fix it (or get
it fixed by the maintainers).
