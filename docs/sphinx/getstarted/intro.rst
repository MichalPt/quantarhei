Quantarhei Philosophy
=====================

Here is something about the main philosophy of Quantarhei


Open Quantum Systems
====================

Here is something about molecular open quantum systems as a subject of research. We specify for which systems Quantarhei is aimed.


Representation of Molecular Systems in Quantarhei
=================================================

Here we describe how molecular systems are represented in Quantathei. We distinguish three different components of molecular open quantum systems. 

Molecules
---------

At the center of everything are **Molecules** as the basic building blocks. They are characterized by the spatial structure (often in a limited representation which comprises e.g. just their *positions* and *transition dipole moments*) and energy level structure. Most often we represent molecules as two-level systems.

Molecular Environment
---------------------

Unless the molecules are in gas phase, they are naturally embedded is some kind of an environment. Actually, even in gaas phases the molecules interact with electromagnetic field, and we can therefore still consider them embedded in an environment, and therefore open.
